Abstract:

Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune responses and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems vaccinology can combine data and machine learning 
techniques to obtain highly predictive signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Currently, several machine learning methods are already available to researchers with no background in bioinformatics.

Problem Statement:
    
Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.

Scope:

●	Exploratory data analysis
●	Data Pre-processing
●	Training logistic regression model with MLE for prediction
●	Tuning the model to improve the performance
